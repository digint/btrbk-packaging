btrbk (0.23.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
  * INCOMPATIBLE CONFIGURATION:
    * Please read "doc/upgrade_to_v0.23.0.md" for details on updating
      the configuration file (/etc/btrbk/btrbk.conf).
    * Dropped "btrfs_progs_compat" option. Need btrfs-progs >= v3.18.
    * Removed "resume_missing" configuration option.
  * Create backups only if needed to satisfy retention policy.
  * Preserve FIRST backup of hour/day/week/month instead of LAST.
  * Replaced "{snapshot,target}_preserve_{daily,weekly,monthly}"
    configuration options with "{snapshot,target}_preserve_min" and
    "{snapshot,target}_preserve NNh NNd NNw NNm NNy" options.
  * Added hourly/yearly retention policies.
  * Allow regular directories for send-receive targets.
  * Allow wildcards in subvolume section.
  * Propagate targets defined in "volume" or "root" context to all
    "subvolume" sections.
  * Added "archive" command.
  * Changed output format of "origin" command, add table formats.
  * Added configuration option "rate_limit".
  * Added new timestamp_format "long-iso", having a timezone postfix.
  * Added "--print-schedule" command line option.
  * Detect interrupted transfers of raw targets.
  * Always read "readonly" flag (additional call to btrfs-progs).
  * Warn on receive targets at unexpected location (instead of abort).
  * On incremental send/receive, use all snapshots sharing same
    parent_uuid as candidates for "-p <parent>" instead of only older
    snapshots. As last resort, use subvolumes in snapshot_dir matching
    btrbk file name scheme as candidates (which allows incremental
    backups after the parent vanished, e.g. after backup restore).
  * Use perl built-in Time::Local instead of Date::Calc.
  * Improvements of internal data structures.
